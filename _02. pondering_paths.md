# Pondering Paths

>The Linux filesystem is a "tree". That is, it has a root.You refer to files and directories by their path. A path from the root of the filesystem starts with /

Learnt about absolute paths, invoking commands from absolute and relative paths, the differences between implicit and explicit relative paths, parent and self directories and home directory expansions and what '~' means at the beginning of every prompt.

## 2.1 The_root
>Alright, so the filesystem starts at /. You can invoke a program by providing its path on the command line.This style of path, one that starts with the root directory, is referred to as an "absolute path".

Reading and learning that absolute paths start from the root directory, it was easy to invoke the program using its absolute path.

## 2.2 Program_and_absolute_paths
>This challenge again requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path.

Running the 'run' program from within a directory which itself is in a root directory was not tricky to figure out.

## 2.3 Position_thy_self
>The Linux filesystem has tons of directories with tons of files. You can navigate around directories by using the cd command. This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path.


The use of the 'cd' command was taught in our PPS lab subject, running the program and getting information about where to actually run it from (by ' cd'ing ' to it) was not a difficult task.

## 2.4 Position_elsewhere
This program and 2.5 were mirrors of 2.4, replicated execution with not much trickyness.

## 2.5 Position_yet_elsewhere
As stated earlier, this program is also a replica of 2.3 and 2.4 with different arguments but the same concept.
