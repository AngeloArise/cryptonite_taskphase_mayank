# Practicing piping
>This module will teach you about input and output redirection. Simply put, every process in Linux has three initial, standard channels of communication:

Standard Input is the channel through which the process takes input. For example, your shell uses Standard Input to read the commands that you input.
Standard Output is the channel through which processes output normal data, such as the flag when it is printed to you in previous challenges or the output of utilities such as ls.
Standard Error is the channel through which processes output error details. For example, if you mistype a command, the shell will output, over standard error, that this command does not exist.

## 6.1 Redirecting Output
>First, let's look at redirect stdout to files. You can accomplish this with the > character.

using ``` echo PWN > college ```, we can write the output of the

### Flag
```
pwn.college{YksszvW6q9HMeGuCI3a6s4gevgF.dRjN1QDLwETN0czW}
```
<br>
<br>

## 6.2 Redirecting more output
>Aside from redirecting the output of echo, you can, of course, redirect the output of any command.

Redirected the output of /challenge/run to a separate file, Found that file using the ``` find ``` command, and catt'ed it out to the terminal.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{UNaytNE_Y8fIEEuPLZLTVCYhxq-.dVjN1QDLwETN0czW}
```
<br>
<br>

## 6.3 Appending output
>A common use-case of output redirection is to save off some command results for later analysis. Often times, you want to do this in aggregate: run a bunch of commands, save their output, and grep through it later.

This can be done using '>>' instead of '>', this 'append' mode will write all the contents of all commands to the same file, aggregating them all.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{Yd8tNifXyk3Ljth0FsTrbhq_UNZ.ddDM5QDLwETN0czW}
```

## 6.4 Redirecting errors
>Just like standard output, you can also redirect the error channel of commands. A File Descriptor (FD) is a number the describes a communication channel in Linux. You've already been using them, even though you didn't realize it.
>FD 0: Standard Input
FD 1: Standard Output
FD 2: Standard Error


This is very useful for, almost anything and everything needing to be built or executed, to funnel the errors and output into different files using minimal characters is unsurprisingly efficient.

Syntax: ``` some_command > output.log 2> errors.log ``` 
That command will redirect output to output.log and errors to errors.log.

## 6.5 Redirecting input
>Just like you can redirect output from programs, you can redirect input to programs! This is done using <.

Directed the text 'COLLEGE' to PWN, then redirected input of PWN to /challenge/run, and it read the text 'COLLEGE' out of it, then gave the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{olMlvsCAdfoTr4nl10WkyyHcr2k.dBzN1QDLwETN0czW}
```

## 6.6 Grepping stored results

This challenge was straight forward, required the use of grep and redirection at the same time.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{A424silU11FakKKdP4HqzI0rUzB.dhTM4QDLwETN0czW}
```
<br>
<br>

# 6.7 Grepping live output
>It turns out that you can "cut out the middleman" and avoid the need to store results to a file, like you did in the last level. You can use this using the | (pipe) operator.

The pipe operator, pipes Standard output from command from left of the pipe to the standard input of the command right of the pipe. Essentially writing 1 lline of code instead of 2 in this case.

### Flag 
```
pwn.college{A-QsN3fMihEl_DlogGOhJTlc34T.dlTM4QDLwETN0czW}
```
<br>
<br>

## 6.8 Grepping errors
>The | operator redirects only standard output to another program, and there is no 2| form of the operator! It can only redirect standard output (file descriptor 1).



### Flag
```
pwn.college{AtHO0WNJocAqQk9R6Ba4nwsfuf3.dVDM5QDLwETN0czW}
```
<br>
<br>

## 6.9 Duplicating piped data with tee
>When you pipe data from one command to another, you of course no longer see it on your screen. This is not always desired: for example, you might want to see the data as it flows through between your commands to debug unintended outcomes.


### Flag
