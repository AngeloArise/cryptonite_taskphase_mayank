# Chaining Commnds
>In the piping module, you've explored the concept of using several commands, with data flowing between them via pipes, to accomplish something slightly more complex than the individual commands can do. Of course, this concept also applies independent of the data transfer: sometimes, you might want to run several commands in quick succession to achieve up some cumulative effect.

## 11.1 Chaining with semicolons
>The easiest way to chain commands is ;. In most contexts, ; separates commands in a similar way to how Enter separates lines.

User can run multiple commands in the same terminal in one line, chained with a semicolon, as the semicolon gives the prompt to input another command.

### Flag
This challenge requires the user to chain 2 commands to get the flag
```
pwn.college{cufIfjnBkdJnD20YDwgvN1RQbNX.dVTN4QDLwETN0czW}
```
<br>
<br>

## 11.2 Your first shell script
>As you combine more and more commands to achieve complex effects, the length of the combined prompt quickly gets really annoying to deal with. When this happens, you can put these commands in a file, called a shell script, and run them by executing the file.
>```
>echo COLLEGE > pwn
>cat pwn
>hacker@dojo:~$ ls
>hacker@dojo:~$ bash pwn.sh
>COLLEGE
>hacker@dojo:~$ ls
>pwn
>hacker@dojo:~$
>```

Instead of chaining infinite commands using semicolons, user can put these commands in a shell script, and run them by executing the file.

### Flag
This challenge requires the user to run 2 commands in a shell script, and then run the shell script.
