# Perceiving permissions
>This module will expose you to Linux permissions, which is one of the most important part of your journey going ahead.
In Linux, files have different permissions or file modes. You can check out a permissions of a file or directory using ```ls -l```

```
>hacker@dojo:~$ mkdir pwn_directory
>hacker@dojo:~$ touch college_file
>hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l
>total 4
>-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker    0 May 22 13:42 college_file
>drwxr-xr-x 2 hacker hacker 4096 May 22 13:42 pwn_directory
>hacker@dojo:~$
```

>The first character of each line represents the file type. In pwn_directory's case, the d indicates that it's a directory, and in college_file's case, the - represents that it's a normal file.

>The next nine characters are the actual access permissions of the file or directory.
>There are two columns showing the user that owns the file (in this case, user hacker) and then the group that owns the file (in this case, also group hacker).


## 9.1 Changing file ownership
>Every file in Linux is owned by a user on the system. Most often, in your day-to-day life, that user is the user you log in as every day.
>root. This is the administrative account and, in most security situations, the ultimate prize. If you take over the root user, you've almost certainly achieved your hacking objective.

This program teaches how to change permissions of files, specifically the user permission. We can do this using the ```chown``` command, which can typically be only accessed by the root user, however for this challenge this is an exception.

Syntax: ``` chown userName fileName ```

### Flag
This challenge required the user to change the owner of the /flag file.
```
pwn.college{QOftR8AcB8L19UsRjwQpKI02OYu.dFTM2QDLwETN0czW}
```

## 9.2 Groups and files
>Sharing is caring, and sharing is built into Linux's design. Files have both an owning user and group. A group can have multiple users in it, and a user can be a member of multiple groups.

We can change the permissons of a file, we can also change the group ownership of a file, which also typically can only be done by the root user.

Syntax: ``` chgrp grpName fileName ```

One can also check what group they are in using the ```id``` command.

### Flag
This challenge required the user to change the permission of the /flag files group and read the file.
```
pwn.college{I22oXV-sk_2RxvE-WzzvNf6Qysc.dFzNyUDLwETN0czW}
