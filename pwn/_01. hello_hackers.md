## 1.1 Intro to commands

>In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag!

Using the demonstrated use of the ```whoami``` command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal, I executed the ```hello``` command.

## 1.2 Intro to arguments

>A command with arguments, which is what we call additional data passed to the command.

Syntax: ``` the_command the_argument ```
<br>

With the demonstrated use of the ```echo``` command, which 'echoes' the arguments in the terminal, it was easy to run the ```hello``` command with the specified argument.
