## 4.1 Learning from documentation
>The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, in the proper specification of arguments to them.
>Welcome to the documentation for /challenge/challenge! To properly run this program, you will need to pass it the argument of --giveflag. Good luck!

Challenge required to pass an argument while accessing the directory/file of the flag, simple in concept.

### Flag
``` pwn.college{khTfi0ioBmoWZfxx1LrqQ6jQ08m.dRjM5QDLwETN0czW} ```

## 4.2 Learning complex usage
>Somewhere on the spectrum between cd and awk are commands that take arguments to their arguments...

Specifying arguements to already entered arguments is not new, as mentioned in the challenge this has been encountered before in the challenge requiring 'find -name'.

## 4.3 Reading manuals
>This level introduces the man command. man is short for manual, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument.
>You can scroll around the manpage with your arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn. When you're done reading the manpage, you can hit q to quit.
