# 7 Shell Variables
>The Linux command line interface is actually a sophisticated programming language with which you can write actual programs! Because the command line interface is colloquially referred to as a "shell", programs written in this language are referred to as "shell scripts".


## 7.1 Printing variables
>Let's start with printing variables out.

## 7.2 Setting variables
>Naturally, as well as reading values stored in variables, you can write values to variables. This is done, as with many other languages, using ```=```.

Careful not to use spaces, as shell will try to execute the variable (?), if it reads a space after the variable, and executing a variable is not possible. Also, ```$``` is only used to access variables, not write to them.
