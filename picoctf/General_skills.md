## Super SSH (easy)
When i completed TP1, the additional challenge i was given was 'bandit over the wire', and the first challenge of that series of challenges was to ssh onto the website using a specific port. Learned how to ssh using a specific port there.

## Runme.py (easy)
This looked fairly easy, however the description said i can use a command ```wget``` to install a file from a URL. Very useful to learn since I don't necessarily need to open the browser to install files now.

### Flag
```
picoCTF{run_s4n1ty_run}
```

## First find
I used ```find``` to find the file using the command line. Going fairly easy for now, will gear up in the next few days.
