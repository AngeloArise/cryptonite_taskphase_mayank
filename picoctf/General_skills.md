## Super SSH (easy)
When i completed TP1, the additional challenge i was given was 'bandit over the wire', and the first challenge of that series of challenges was to ssh onto the website using a specific port. Learned how to ssh using a specific port there.

### Flag
Challenge required the user to ssh onto a server with a password and on a specific given port
```
picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_5d09a462}
```
<br>
<br>

## Runme.py (easy)
This looked fairly easy, however the description said i can use a command ```wget``` to install a file from a URL. Very useful to learn since I don't necessarily need to open the browser to install files now.

### Flag
Challenge required the user to download and run a python file given in the description
```
picoCTF{run_s4n1ty_run}
```
<br>
<br>

## First find (easy)
I used ```find``` to find the file using the command line. Going fairly easy for now, will gear up in the next few days.

### Flag
Challenge required the user to find a text file in a relatively dense group of folders.
```
picoCTF{f1nd_15_f457_ab443fd1}
```
<br>
<br>

## Lets warm up (easy)

### Flag
Challenge required the user to convert hex to ASCII.
