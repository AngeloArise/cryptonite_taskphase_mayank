# Reverse Engineering
This is the first of the 'categories' I will be starting out with, not really aiming to look at videos or resources for now, just doing easy challenges and learning by hit and trial, I personally think its the
best way to go about it.
## GDB Test Drive (easy)
Did NOT understand directly going for the reverse engineering problems, this one had a lot more solves and was named "test drive".
Was pretty simple to figure out, the instructions were right there in the challenge description, could not copy the flag though, i had to type it out.

## Vault-door-training (easy)
Doing a few more easy problems to get the hang of it, this one looked intimidating with a java file, considering i have interacted with those only twice in my life.
This one was pretty simple, might(will) change going forward.
